        "question": "How did Syntax and Able collaborate to quickly launch a successful value-based care application?",
        "answer": "Syntax aims to streamline and scale the value-based care contracting process by leveraging analytics, infrastructure, and a collaborative virtual workspace. We built Syntax to help teams model and negotiate value-based care at scale so they can focus their expertise on achieving value-based care objectives, improving outcomes, and reducing costs. Able joined Syntax's founding team as their product development partner and had a clear mission: to expedite launching a customer-ready, commercially viable product. Our team, comprising design and engineering talent, refined Syntax's product requirements and established a roadmap for delivering an MVP within six months. Our team met this ambitious goal and defined, designed, and developed a production-ready application within the timeframe. This accomplishment enabled Syntax to present a fully functional MVP application to potential customers. In our second phase of work with Syntax, we successfully developed a customer-ready version of the product and poised the business for scalability. Subsequently, Syntax began acquiring and onboarding its first customers, reaching revenue status in the first 12 months of launch. This remarkable journey spanned 11 months from conceptualization to establishing a fully-fledged, value-generating solution. —Rachael Jones, CEO of Syntax The collective achievements of Syntax and Able stand as a testament to our commitment to providing our partners with a concentrated burst of premium product engineering expertise with the shared goal of accelerating the zero-to-market journey with a fixed amount of pre-seed funding. “Able is a go-to-market cheat code for early founder teams. Without them, we couldn’t have moved this fast (and with such high quality).” —Will Hudgins, VP of Engineering Syntax Taking the Pain Out of Moving"

        "question": "How has We The Action's platform evolved to address key social and political challenges since its inception?",
        "answer": "In key moments of social and political upheaval, it’s essential to quickly harness the energy and scale of volunteer expertise to respond to the moment. After the 2016 presidential election, We The Action (a nonprofit now part of Civic Nation) formed and partnered with Able to build a platform to do just that. Nonprofits, often understaffed, don’t have the ability to effectively respond to offers to help, especially during times of social upheaval when hundreds want to get involved. On the other side of the equation, skilled volunteers often don’t know where they should go to help. WeTheAction.orglaunched in 2017, with the goal of making it easier for nonprofits to quickly structure projects and connect with legal volunteers, and for legal professionals to easily identify the pro bono opportunities that match their experience, interests, and schedule. Since then, activism in the US has evolved and become an essential part of everyday discourse. In response, we’ve innovated our platform to provide the power of scale, the simplicity of focus, and the network effect of multiple distributed teams working toward a common goal. The Supreme Court Dobbs Decision.We The Action was built to respond to moments in history like this. The easy to use platform allowed us to quickly onboard new partners as we helped identify impactful ways for volunteer lawyers to ensure that access to safe and effective abortion care remains available to as many people as possible. The Afghan Refugee Crisis.In 2021 our platform powered the Welcome Legal Alliance's (WLA) effort to recruit lawyers and connect them with the nearly 80,000 Afghan refugees seeking legal assistance. The 2020 Recount in Georgia.Shortly after the polls closed on election night, we recruited over 250 lawyers to prepare for a recount in Georgia. Our platform helped lawyers see where they were needed, attend a training, and observe the vote tally in 40 counties around Georgia. Over the last five years, We The Action has built a community of over 43,000 lawyers and over 500 nonprofit partners.The result is $112 million in pro bono legal work delivered toward American democracy’s most pressing issues, and counting.

    {
        "question": "What strategy did Updater implement to improve user engagement during the moving process, and what impact did it have on their business?",
        "answer": "Established in 2010, Updater’s vision is to make moving a frictionless and delightful experience. They deliver this by helping users organize and complete moving-related tasks like booking movers, buying boxes, securing insurance, setting up services like utilities, TV, and internet, and more. Updater hadn’t built a mobile app because its users weren’t demanding one – historically, Updater found that people weren’t willing to download an app for such a short period of time (while preparing for a move). But, as the business grew and Updater began to tackle both pre- and post-move needs, the Updater team realized that their reliance on email, SMS, and mobile web could be better complemented with a mobile app. Updater approached Able to help craft and implement a new mobile strategy that would lay a strong foundation for the future and help them engage with users throughout the move journey in a modern way. Because “moving season” takes place every summer in America and Updater reached out in early Spring, we knew that transitioning user behaviors to the app fast was the key to ensure continuous and increased revenue for moving season. Our strategy prioritized speed over feature expansion to capture revenue and better serve customers when they need Updater the most. Our development approach applied a hybrid app strategy, leveraging React Native, web wrappers, and web views to create the initial release in less than three months. After launch, we cycled through the app to replace wrappers with native components where we felt the impact justified the effort. We also conducted a thorough UX review and introduced a consistent design system using Updater’s design components. The success of the initial release and UX enhancements have helped Updater triple its order rates for critical products within the app—a primary driver for their business. The dramatic impact of the work on their bottom line was the validation Updater needed to double-down on the future of their mobile app, and we are looking forward to building more incredible tech as partners.

Our recommendations also included adopting best practices for service versioning, dependency management, and security compliance. We conducted an in-depth evaluation of micro-services, highlighting both the benefits and the challenges, including increased operational complexity, data management issues, and communication overhead. As a simpler alternative, we proposed a modular monolith approach, which reduces complexity and streamlines operations. On the front end, we recommended framework updates to achieve a modern stack with less development overhead and advised reducing unnecessary dependencies to further improve efficiency.
