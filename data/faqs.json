        "question": "Output",
        "answer": "We provided several high-level recommendations to enhance system performance and streamline operations. We identified the need for modifications to existing services, such as implementing web-hooks and notifications, and advised the deletion of unused code while emphasizing the importance of following the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. Additionally, we suggested better utilization of AWS tools like Cloud Map for service discovery and management. Our recommendations also included adopting best practices for service versioning, dependency management, and security compliance. We conducted an in-depth evaluation of micro-services, highlighting both the benefits and the challenges, including increased operational complexity, data management issues, and communication overhead. As a simpler alternative, we proposed a modular monolith approach, which reduces complexity and streamlines operations. On the front end, we recommended framework updates to achieve a modern stack with less development overhead and advised reducing unnecessary dependencies to further improve efficiency."
